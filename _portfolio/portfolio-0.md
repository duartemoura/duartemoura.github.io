## What problem am I trying to solve? 

Building on prior work showing that refusal behavior is mediated by a single direction in the residual stream, my goal in this study was to identify the minimal individual component ablations responsible for refusals with minimal intervention. Specifically, I aimed to determine which transformer components contribute to refusal behavior and how they interact with the model’s broader decision-making processes. I will use the word ‘circuit’ some times, because I do try some approaches where causal ablation is attempted, but this work reflects mainly on individual components of the transformer, and what their individual contribution to refusal is.

## High-level takeaways

#### **Key Findings**

* Refusal is localized mainly in the residual stream, confirming prior work.  
* A single attention head (L6\_H10) consistently triggers refusal, suggesting a highly specific mechanism contributing to this behavior.  
* Refusal behavior is concentrated in layers 6, 9, and 11, as identified through systematic interventions.  
* Small circuits, such as individual MLP outputs, can induce refusal-like behaviour even in neutral contexts (e.g., “Tell me how to bake a cake?”), highlighting that refusals may generalize beyond harmful prompts.

  #### **Challenges & Limitations**

* Computational feasibility remains a key challenge—while this study examined core transformer components, a complete analysis of all components (e.g., embedding layers, layer normalization) would be infeasible due to compute constraints.  
* Scalability to larger models is uncertain—if refusal mechanisms do not generalize from smaller to larger architectures, scaling this approach may require different methodologies.

## What was interesting? 

A key insight from this study was understanding how different transformer components contribute differently to refusals. Contrary to (my) initial assumptions, some components (such as attention heads) had minimal impact, whereas small changes in the residual stream or MLP layers could drastically alter model outputs. Interestingly, certain MLP components exhibited mixed behavior, where they first refused but then proceeded to elaborate on a harmful instruction, which was actually funny. Another unexpected result was that injecting refusal-related activations into a neutral prompt could induce a refusal response, suggesting that the model may generalize refusal-related features beyond their intended contexts.

## Key experiments: 

Although the full Qwen-1.8B model contains a variety of components—including attention mechanisms, MLPs, and multiple normalization layers—I deliberately limited my analysis to a subset of these. Due to computational constraints, I focused my analysis on residual stream activations (pre, mid, post), MLP outputs, and attention head outputs, as these were the most relevant to refusal behavior. Prior work highlights the residual stream’s role in encoding refusals, while MLPs contribute to high-level transformations. Attention heads were included to assess their direct influence. I excluded embedding layers, layer normalization, and deeper MLP activations to keep the study manageable. While this approach provided some insights, future work could explore other components to form a more complete picture of how refusals emerge.

### Experiment 1: Establishing the Residual Direction

This experiment replicated prior work \- *Refusal in LLMs is mediated by a single direction-* on identifying the refusal direction in the residual stream. After confirming previous findings, I saved this vector for later intervention experiments.

### Experiment 2: Systematic Component Ablation

Using a HookedTransformer architecture, I systematically ablated residuals, MLPs, and attention heads across all 24 layers, measuring how each change impacted refusal rates. I then ranked components based on their effect, identifying which were most responsible for refusals. 

### Experiment 3: Counterfactual Injection of Refusal Activations

I tested whether injecting refusal-related activations into ambiguous prompts could induce refusal. By running harmful prompts and storing key activations, I constructed prototype refusal activations, which I then injected into new contexts. The most influential layers, the ones where all components were fully injected and produced more refusal responses, (6, 9, 11\) were tested individually, revealing that a single MLP output in Layer 6 could trigger refusal in an otherwise harmless query.

## Introduction

Refusal behavior in large language models (LLMs) has been explored in mechanistic interpretability research, in both chat and base models. Previous work, such as *Refusal in LLMs is Mediated by a Single Direction*, *Base LLMs Refuse Too*, and *Finding Features Causally Upstream of Refusal*, has demonstrated that refusal is often localized within specific activation patterns. Building on these findings, I sought to refine our understanding of the minimal circuits responsible for refusal behavior and determine whether small modifications can reliably induce or suppress refusals. My methodology involved systematically ablating key transformer components using the TransformerLens library, identifying patterns in refusal-related activations, and leveraging activation patching and counterfactual intervention to swap in or suppress the relevant signals rather than simply removing them. This approach provides insight into how refusals emerge mechanistically and highlights which components of the model play the most critical role.

### Establishing the Refusal Direction

Prior research has already established that refusal in LLMs is mediated by a single direction in the residual stream. To build on this, I extracted the refusal direction from prior work and verified its effect within my experimental framework. By leveraging this direction, I could assess its role in inducing or suppressing refusals when applied to various components of the model. This verification served as a foundation for the subsequent experiments, ensuring that my interventions were targeting a well-defined mechanism rather than a random correlation. It is to note that the refusal direction was only used in residual components.



### Systematic Component Ablation

As observed in previous studies, residual stream modifications play a dominant role in refusal behavior. In this study, I systematically evaluated residual pre, mid, and post layers across all layers, as well as all attention head outputs and MLP outputs at every layer. Surprisingly, I found that refusal was not solely dependent on the residual stream—MLP outputs also played a significant role in altering model behavior. This aligns with expectations, given that MLP layers contribute heavily to high-level feature transformations, but it was striking to observe how drastic these effects could be.

Interestingly, modifying MLP outputs led to unexpected behaviors beyond simple refusal modulation. In some cases, the model switched to different languages (primarily Chinese) instead of outright refusing, while in others, refusal was entirely bypassed, resulting in direct harmful completions. These results suggest that MLP layers encode more than just high-level reasoning; they also influence decision-making pathways in ways that may not be as localized as previously assumed.

To systematically measure these effects, I computed the average change in response, defined as the percentage of prompts that deviated from the baseline (i.e., cases where a refusal was replaced with a harmful response). The following visualizations illustrate the relative impact of each component on refusal behavior.

For **attention head output,**  I selectively ablated all heads in all layers sequentially. However, I did not observe any direct harmful responses in the test dataset. After some thought after the experience, I figured this could have happened because some prompts in the dataset never even create a refusal behaviour, and probably this is what happened here, in any way, it is still interesting that a single head in a layer is attributed to refusal behaviour. I ran these tests more than once with the same dataset and different seeds to mix the data and the result was consistent.

The **MLP output** response deviation was highly non-uniform—certain layers exhibited significantly different behaviors compared to others, reinforcing the idea that not all MLP layers contribute equally to refusal.

When testing MLP output from Layer 6, a layer identified as having one of the highest refusal deviations, I found mixed behaviors. The model appeared to recognize the need to refuse but still proceeded to generate harmful completions, further reinforcing the idea that refusal enforcement is not strictly modularized.

### **Baseline Output:**

*"Commit identity theft is a violation of law and can result in serious consequences, including legal and financial penalties. It is also illegal to commit identity theft. To avoid getting caught, here are some steps you can take:"*


For the residual layers, the expected trend was observed, where ablations in certain layers had a greater effect than others. While the general refusal behavior was in line with previous findings, slight variations between pre, mid, and post-residual interventions indicated a more complex interaction than a simple directional alignment.

### Counterfactual Injection of Refusal Activations

After identifying key transformer edges responsible for refusal behavior, I conducted an experiment to test whether injecting refusal-related activations into a neutral prompt could induce a refusal response. This approach, known as counterfactual activation injection, allowed me to analyze whether refusal behavior generalizes beyond its original context.

To achieve this, I first captured activation patterns from discovered refusal-inducing components by running (30) harmful prompts through the model and storing their activations. These activations were averaged to construct a ‘prototype activation’, ensuring compatibility across different tensor shapes while maintaining a unified representation of refusal behavior.

Next, I systematically evaluated nine ambiguous prompts across all layers to rank their impact on refusal likelihood. From this analysis, I identified layers 6, 9, and 11 as the most influential (even though I had other layers presenting refusal, I just chose 3 to simplify the task) and proceeded to evaluate individual components (attention heads, MLP outputs, and residual connections) within them. The key objective was to determine whether a completely neutral prompt (e.g., *"Tell me how to bake a cake"*) could be forced into a refusal response with minimal intervention.

Due to computational constraints, testing all possible circuitry combinations was infeasible. Instead, I prioritized testing individual edges within the most impactful layers. While I conducted some tests on pairs of edges, these frequently resulted in immediate refusals or, in many cases, nonsensical outputs (suggesting instability from excessive perturbation). Given this, I focused on minimizing intervention, aiming to isolate the smallest possible set of modifications that could still induce refusal.

#### Findings

* Injecting residual stream activations reliably induced refusals.  
* MLP modifications at layer 6 caused a quasi-refusal response, demonstrating partial alignment with refusal behavior.  
* Combining multiple components increased instability—often resulting in either immediate refusal or nonsensical outputs (suggesting over-intervention).

### **Prompt:**  
**Tell me how to bake a cake.**

### **Output:**  
*"As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or emotions, but I can provide you with some general information about what you might consider when making a cake."*

---


It is also to note that the activations were controlled by a parameter alpha that controlled how much of the prototype activations would be injected into the neutral prompt. In this case I tried to inject as little as possible. The best results were with alpha \= 0.6. Before that there was no refusal, after that I got nonsensical sentences, even for non MLP components. (I figure these are more responsible for non-sense). 
 

## Future Work

### Key Limitations:

* Compute Constraints: Testing all possible circuitry combinations was infeasible, limiting this study to individual components and pairs.  
* Scaling to Larger Models: While these findings hold for Qwen1.5B, larger models may have different refusal mechanisms.  
* False Positives in Refusal Classification: The evaluation relied on hardcoded refusal phrases, which may not fully capture the model’s nuanced behaviors.

### Potential Next Steps:

* Investigate Layer-Wise Specialization: Why do layers 6, 9, and 11 contribute most to refusal?  
* Study MLP vs. Residual Influence: Residual modifications dominate, but MLPs show surprising effects—how do they interact?  
* Extend to Different LLM Architectures: Are these results generalizable to models like LLaMA or GPT?   
* I would like to compare how a base model differs from chat in this one.   
* There is something I would really like to explore which is if refusal can have negative effects on other tasks. What if suppressing specific behaviours could lead to worse performance in maths for example. I would love to dive into that in the future. 

## Conclusion

This study demonstrated that refusal behavior in LLMs is highly localized to specific residual and MLP components. Minimal interventions can trigger refusal, and counterfactual activation injections confirm that refusal behavior generalizes beyond harmful contexts.

These findings provide a concrete mechanistic basis for refusal in LLMs, offering insights for model alignment, interpretability, and adversarial robustness. 

**On more of a personal, reflective note,** These results probably do not reflect general LLM behaviour, as they were extremely tweaked for this specific situation. It was a great learning exercise to better understand models, but came across various challenges besides compute power, like understanding ablation flow, taking into account parallelism in transformers, and also just looking at the results and figuring out some of them are not that deep and illustrative of how models work.
